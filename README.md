# UML - Unified Modelling Language

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized modeling language used in software engineering to visualize, specify, construct, and document the structure and behavior of software systems. 

Developed by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh in the 1990s, UML provides a set of graphical notation techniques to create abstract models of software systems. These models help stakeholders understand complex systems, facilitate communication, and ensure that the software meets its requirements.

## â˜… Purposes and Benefits

**Clarification and Communication:** UML diagrams serve as a common language between developers, analysts, and stakeholders. They clarify the design and requirements, making it easier to communicate complex ideas.

**Design and Planning:** UML aids in designing system architecture and planning the development process. It helps in creating blueprints for software that align with business goals.

**Documentation:** UML provides a structured way to document software designs and architecture, which is invaluable for maintenance, future development, and onboarding new team members.

**Analysis and Validation:** By visualizing the system, UML helps in analyzing requirements and validating that the design meets the intended goals and constraints.

## ðŸ”— Types of Relationships

UML defines various types of relationships to model different aspects of interactions and dependencies between classes and objects. Hereâ€™s an overview of some key relationships:

### 1. Association

Association represents a general relationship between two classes. It indicates that objects of one class are connected to objects of another class.

Examples:

* _Customer_ and _Order_: A Customer places multiple Orders, and each Order is associated with a Customer.
* _Teacher_ and _Student_: A Teacher teaches multiple Students, and each Student is associated with a Teacher.
* _Doctor_ and _Patient_: A Doctor can have multiple Patients, and each Patient can be associated with multiple Doctors for different health issues.

### 2. Aggregation

Aggregation is a type of association that represents a "whole-part" relationship where the part can exist independently of the whole. Itâ€™s a weaker relationship compared to composition.

Examples:

* _Library_ and _Book_: A Library contains multiple Books, but each Book can exist outside the context of a particular Library.
* _Engine_ and _Car_: A Car contains an Engine. An Engine can exist independently of a Car, even though it's typically used within one.
* _Order_ and _Items_: An Order "has" Items. Items can exist independently of the Order (they might be canceled or modified).

### 3. Composition

Composition is a stronger form of aggregation where the lifetime of the part is dependent on the lifetime of the whole. If the whole is destroyed, the parts are also destroyed.

Examples:

* _House_ and _Room_: A House is composed of several Rooms. If the House is demolished, the Rooms no longer exist.
* _Chapter_ and _Book_: A Book is made up of several Chapters. If the Book is removed or destroyed, the Chapters are inherently lost as well.

Aggregation and Composition are subsets of association, meaning they are specific cases of association. In both aggregation and composition object of one class "owns" object of another class. But there is a subtle difference:

Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. Example: Class (parent) and Student (child). Delete the Class and the Students still exist.  
Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent. Example: House (parent) and Room (child). Rooms don't exist separate to a House.

### 4. Inheritance

Inheritance denotes a relationship where a class (subclass) inherits attributes and behaviors from another class (superclass). It models an "is-a" relationship.

Examples:

* _Animal_ and _Dog_: Dog is a subclass of Animal, inheriting properties like eat() and sleep() from Animal.
* _Vehicle_ and _Car_: Car is a subclass of Vehicle, inheriting characteristics like drive() and refuel() from Vehicle.
* _Employee_ and _Manager_: Manager is a subclass of Employee, inheriting general employee properties but with additional managerial responsibilities.

### 5. Realization

Realization is a relationship between an interface and a class that implements that interface. It indicates that a class provides concrete behavior for the operations defined in an interface.

Examples:

* _Drawable Interface_ and _Circle Class_: The Circle class might realize the Drawable interface, providing the implementation for the methods defined in the interface, such as draw().
* _RemoteControl Interface_ and _TV Class_: The TV class might realize the RemoteControl interface, implementing methods to turn the TV on and off and change channels.
* _Shape Interface_ and _Classes Circle, Rectangle, Triangle_: All implement the Shape interface, providing their specific implementations for calculating area and perimeter.

### 6. Dependency

Dependency indicates a relationship where one element (the client) depends on another element (the supplier) such that a change in the supplier may affect the client. This relationship is often used to show that one class uses another class or relies on it in some way.

Examples:

* _Class A_ and _Class B_: Class A might depend on Class B if Class A uses Class Bâ€™s methods or attributes.
* _Class Logger_ and _Class File_: Logger might use File to write log messages to a file.
* _Class DatabaseConnection_ and _Class SqlConnection_: DatabaseConnection might use SqlConnection to establish a connection to a database.
    
### 7. Association Class

Association Class is used to add attributes and operations to an association between classes. It represents a relationship that has its own properties and behavior.

Examples:

* Enrollment in a _Course_ and _Student_: An Enrollment association class could link Course and Student and include attributes like enrollmentDate and methods for enrolling and dropping courses.
* Project Assignment between _Employee_ and _Project_: The ProjectAssignment association class might include attributes such as assignmentDate and role, and operations for managing assignments.
* Contract between _Supplier_ and _Customer_: A Contract association class could link Supplier and Customer, including details like contractTerms and startDate.
